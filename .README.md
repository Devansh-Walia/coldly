we can also use nodemon to rebuild on incremental changes

```bash
    npx nodemon --exec "cargo run" ./src/main.rs
```

How to use:

To send emails using the API, you can use the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/send-emails' \
--form 'file=@"/path to emails.csv"'
```

Replace `"/path to emails.csv"` with the actual path to your CSV file containing the email addresses.

or you can copy the above cURL and paste in postman, attach the file there and then send the email
