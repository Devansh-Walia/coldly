To send emails using Gmail's SMTP server, you need to use an "App Password" instead of your regular Gmail password. This is a security feature that allows you to use your Gmail account with third-party applications securely. Here's how you can generate an App Password:

### Steps to Generate a Gmail App Password

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification**:

   - Go to your Google Account.
   - Navigate to the "Security" section.
   - Under "Signing in to Google," ensure that 2-Step Verification is turned on. If it's not, you'll need to set it up first.

2. **Generate an App Password**:

   - Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, go back to the "Security" section.
   - Under "Signing in to Google," find "App passwords" and click on it.
   - You might need to sign in again for security purposes.
   - In the "Select app" dropdown, choose "Mail" or "Other" (you can name it something like "Rust App").
   - In the "Select device" dropdown, choose the device you're using or "Other" if you want to specify.
   - Click "Generate."
   - Google will provide you with a 16-character password. This is your App Password.

3. **Use the App Password in Your Application**:
   - Replace `your_app_specific_password` in your `.env` file with the generated App Password.

### Important Notes

- **Security**: Keep your App Password secure. Do not share it or expose it in public repositories.
- **Less Secure Apps**: If you're not using App Passwords, you might need to enable "Less secure app access" in your Google Account settings. However, using App Passwords is the recommended and more secure approach.
- **Testing**: After setting up, test sending an email to ensure everything is configured correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to send emails using your Gmail account through your Rust application. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!
